    1 > Media Query_; tells a browser how to style something at a given dimensionof the screen/viewport.
    2 > viewport meta tag:- tells the browser what width the viewport should be and if we zoom in or out
    3 > Responsive Images:- to load a low res img in a mobile.

Now beore making a responsive website we should have some things in mind like how its gonna look in an android device 
and its useability now there are some good practices that you should follow bedore making an responsive website

    1.> Mobile First Aproach---->> first you should make the website keeping the mobile phone in mind so as o just add only the essentials as the viewport is 
    not large  so it forces you to think ina way to preserve most space in the browser window and thn make the desktop version as now it is mush easier
    to make a desktop version.


    2.>Desktop First Aproach --->> it is same as the upper one just a bit more difficult ;-p
