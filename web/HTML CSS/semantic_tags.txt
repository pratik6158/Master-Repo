so lets suppose i am a web browser
and here is an html code 
<div>
<p>This is a message </p>
</div>

the browser cannot understand what is inside the div tag so to deal with that the semantic tags were born
it wasnt really a prob its just therre to make our livse easier. SO here are some examples.

some semantinc tags are as follows:-

<main>
for main content of the page, unique o the page

<section>
defines a certain section of a website (ie blog list and contact info)

<article>
DEFINES a bit of content which makesup an article (ie blog post)

<aside>
defines some content related to something else(similar blogs)

<header>
for headers of a websites contains nav, title, etc

<footer>
for footer of a websites
