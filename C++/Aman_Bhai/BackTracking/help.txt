A rat in a maze problem 

first initialize the and array with all zero 
then as you can see that you could only move in two direction ie right and bottom

the rat has to start from the top left corner to the bottom right corner

1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 1 

so you could only go in the 1 and not in 0

lets define a function solveMazeUtil(maze,x,y,sol)  lets make it short like solve(maze,x,y,sol)

solve(maze[4][4],0,0,sol[4][4])

now lets see if we can go in the which direction as you can see right side is blocked so we have to go in the bottom
